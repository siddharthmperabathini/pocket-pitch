Project Name: PocketPitch: Context dependent keychain with e ink and nfc

Project Idea: We want to create a small keychain-like device that users can use for a variety of use cases. Our current, primary use is for students at career fairs and networking events, where students can use the nfc feature on the keychain or have a recruiter scan the QR code displayed on the e ink display to access their resume, linkedin, and career profile. With the nfc feature, all that is needed is one tap from the keychain to transfer all necessary data to the recruiter’s phone. Beyond this, we believe there is a wide variety of use cases for this type of device, thus we want to make this keychain context dependent, so the e ink display and nfc can vary depending on context. We are also hoping to implement a bluetooth transfer of profile as opposed to an NFC approach, since the Bluetooth approach is more complex.

Project Materials: 

ESP32 Microcontroller:
Handles data storage, communication (NFC/Bluetooth), power management
Should connect to mobile app/computer to update resume and linkedin link
E-Ink Display:
Displays users resume, Linkedin, etc. in a QR format
Low power consumption makes it ideal
NFC/Bluetooth:
NFC: Recruiter taps phone against keychain, opens resume and Linkedin
Alternative format for transferring profile for users with phones without NFC features
